# SIS Node Server
Server built on Node.js to scrape data from [parents.msrit.edu](parents.msrit.edu), the student information portal of [M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology](msrit.edu) for tracking grades and attendance. The data is cached on a MongoDB server and is made available to the [SIS Android app](https://github.com/TechGeekMe/sis-android-app) through an API.
